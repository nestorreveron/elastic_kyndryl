# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
#cluster.name: my-application
cluster.name: kyndryl-elk-lab
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
#node.name: node-1
node.name: es-node-3
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#node.master: true
#node.data: true
#node.ingest: true
node.roles: [ master, data, ingest ]

#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

# Path a repositorio de backups
path.repo: [/var/lib/elasticsearch/backups]

#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
#network.host: 192.168.0.1
network.host: 0.0.0.0

#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
#http.port: 9200
http.port: 9200

#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
#discovery.seed_hosts: ["host1", "host2"]
discovery.seed_hosts: ["10.10.1.4","10.10.1.5","10.10.1.6"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
#cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["node-1", "node-2"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["es-node-1","es-node-2","es-node-3"]

#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: true
#
# ---------------------------------- Security ----------------------------------
#
#                                 *** WARNING ***
#
# Elasticsearch security features are not enabled by default.
# These features are free, but require configuration changes to enable them.
# This means that users don't have to provide credentials and can get full access
# to the cluster. Network connections are also not encrypted.
#
#xpack.security.enabled: false
#xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: false

xpack.security.enabled: true

#Requerido al habilitar la seguridad
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true

xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
xpack.security.transport.ssl.client_authentication: required
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12

#xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false

# This turns on SSL for the HTTP (Rest) interface
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

# This configures the keystore to use for SSL on HTTP
xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: "http.p12"

# To protect your data, we strongly encourage you to enable the Elasticsearch security features. 
# Refer to the following documentation for instructions.
